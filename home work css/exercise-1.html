                <b>To celebrate National</b> Dairy Month
                , we are decorating our own colorful cow. Cows are
                 pretty cool animals, and here in
                  Florida we have a lot of them, with herds ranging 
                 from 150-5,000 cows. Florida dairy cows
                  can produce 6-8 gallons of milk per day, and
                  one gallon of milk is the equivalent of about
                   345 squirts of a cow's udder! Most cows
                   in Florida are black and white cows, but
                   today let's try to make these cows colorful by
                 using a technique called sgraffito, where we scratch the surface.

                June is National Dairy Month, and what better way to celebrate then
                 by making your very own butter. Butter was first discovered 10,000 years 
                 ago and has since been a delicious and helpful piece of everyday cooking. 
                 Butter is made by churning fresh or fermented cream or milk to separate the 
                 butterfat from the buttermilk.
                 Today, we will make our own butter to see firsthand this process.
