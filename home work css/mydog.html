            Owning a dog can bring a lot
            of happiness to your life, but that is not true of every dog. You need to
            know certain things if you want to enjoy your dog’s company. In this article,
            you’ll find suggestions that will help you become a better dog owner.

            It’s good to give hugs, but avoid giving kisses. Dog kisses are adorable,
            but your dog’s mouth is really dirty. Dogs will eat their own waste, dine
            on garbage, and gulp water straight from your toilet. Many people believe
            that dogs’ mouths do not have as much germs as humans’ 
            mouths. That tidbit of information is plain wrong.
            If you have prescription or over-the-counter medication in 
            the house, make sure that your dog does not have access to it.
            Getting into those pills could seriously impact your dog’s health and even
            cause death. If this does happen, call your vet immediately.
